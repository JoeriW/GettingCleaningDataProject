## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain


## Variables
### Labels:

subject

- _description_: identifier of the subject
- _data_  _type_: string
- _values_: 1-30, identifier for the volunteers participating to the expermiments (cfr. Data Set Information)

activity

- _description_: identifies the activities during which the measurements were registered
- _data_  _type_: int
- _values_: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,  WALKING__DOWNSTAIRS SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

### measurement  variables:

- _description_: describes the feature that was measured

- _variable build-up_:

    - time/freq: indicates whether time or frequency domain signals were captured

    - body/gravity: indicates whether body or gravity sensor acceleration signals were captured

    - accelerometer/gyroscopre: indicates the sensor signals

    - jerk/magnitude: body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain jerk signals. Magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclides norm.

    - mean/stdev: indicates whether the average value or standard deviation was measured

    - X/Y/Z:  used to denote the direction of the 3-axial signals.

- _values_: measurements  are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

- _variables_:

## Data Manipulations:

Describing the most significant data manipulations in the run_analysis.R script

- features
    - the second column of features.txt contains the measurements. The first column is dropped
    - only the mean and standard deviation measurments should be kept. (You can discuss about whether or not to keep the meanFreq variables, I didn't...but this choice is debatable)
    - features contains the column names of X_test and X_train. 

- activity_labels:
    - id is used to link the activity label to the activity the volunteers were performing at time of measurement (y_test and y_train file)
    - once linked: id is dropped,only the description is kept

- variable clean up:
    - t. replaced by time.
    - f. replaced by freq.
    - -mean() replaced by mean
    - -std() replaced by stdev
    - Acc replaced by acceloremeter
    - Gyro replaced by gyroscope
    - Mag replaced by magnitude
    - Jerk replaced by jerk
    - BodyBody replaced by body
    - Body replaced by body
    - Gravity replaced by gravity

- tidyset:
   - create tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
   - First melt the data frame, indicate which columns are the id columns (the first 2 columns, being subject and activity)
and which columns are the measure variables (leaving blank means that all non-ids are considered measure variables).
Recast the melted set into a dataframe taking the mean of each variable for each subject and activity
